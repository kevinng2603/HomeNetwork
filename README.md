<h1>Packet Tracer - Configure a Wireless Router and Clients</h1>
<!--
 ### [YouTube Demonstration]

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I will set up a home network for Natsumi, connecting her devices to a cable TV network. The task involves connecting a cable modem and TV using coaxial cables, and linking two PCs to a home wireless router with Ethernet cables. I'll configure the router to manage IP addresses and secure the wireless network using WPA2 Personal. Finally, I'll verify that all devices, including a laptop, can connect to the internet. This ensures a fully operational and secure home network for Natsumi.
